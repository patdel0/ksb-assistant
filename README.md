# Project Overview
The objective is to develop a system with generative capabilities that fulfills the following requirements:

- Ability to run locally for security purposes.
- The system should accept input in the form of my work evidence.
- It should be able to determine the Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours (KSBs) that are aligned with the provided evidence.
- The system should keep a record of the satisfied KSBs and identify the ones that are still outstanding.
- If there are outstanding KSBs, it should prompt me with relevant questions to assist me in documenting work that meets those KSBs.
